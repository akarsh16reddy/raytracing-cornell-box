Please note that rendering can take between 4-12 minutes. Please check the console logs to monitor the render completion percentage, which is logged every 10%. The process is computationally expensive since approximately 100 Monte Carlo samples (light rays) are traced per pixel to achieve smoother global illumination and reduced noise.
